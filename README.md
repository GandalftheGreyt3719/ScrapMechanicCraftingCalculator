# ScrapMechanicCraftingCalculator
Simple crafting calculator made in python3 for Scrap Mechanic by Axolot

To run, open in python ide or in terminal. The program will ask a few questions. Then it will display the required amounts of resources for crafting. Then, the program will ask if you want to craft in bulk. Then, if bulk crafting was selected, the program will ask how many end parts you want, and calculate the total of each resources. 


There is no need to change the os clear function as it is handled by the device, unless the device is OS X, because the program was written on linux, and has support for Windows.

If there are any errors in the crafting, please let me know, and I will correct it.

After Chapter 2 is Released, there will be an updated version with those new crafts along with modded part support. 


In the future, I hope to add a GUI, for easier use.
