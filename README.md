# ScrapmechanicCraftingCalculator
Simple crafting calculator made in python3 for Scrap Mechanic by Axolot

To run, open in python ide or in terminal. The program will ask a few questions, and after the first, a loading screen will play, and ask new questions. Then it will display the required ammounts of resources for crafting. Then, the program will ask if you want to craft in bulk, and will play the loading screen again. Then, if bulk crafting was selected, the program will ask how many end parts you want, and calculate the total of each resources. 

If you want to  make the loading screen faster, edit the loading() function at the begining of the program, but keep the clearscreen() one the same. If you remove the loading(), make sure to use a find and replace to remove it compleatly. 

If there are any errors in the crafting, please let me know, and I will correct it.

After Chapter 2 is Released, there will be an updated version with those new crafts along with modded part support.
